# DnD-Spaceships
A helper app for a Dungeons and Dragons game based in space.

Algorithm used for perception checks of another ship was statistically analysed for reasonable, exponentially scaling difficulty. Graphs are included with the current iteration.

Roll table for random encounters is implemented using a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for efficient, scalable, and statistically fair chances while being very easy to modify the list of possibilities.
